## About 

Safe Stores is an app to help users identify grocery stores based on their public health safety criteria. 

While we suggest staying at home and using contactless delivery for food and supplies, sometimes it may be necessary to shop in stores, especially if delivery isn't available in your area. To help you make an informed decision about which store may be best to shop at, and save time, we've gathered info about popular stores' safety measure and shared it here with you.
